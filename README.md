In this project, we are focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and analysis to extract actionable insights and support decision-making for Zara's sales data. After cleaning and understanding the dataset, we will conduct various analyses to uncover trends and patterns in product sales. The key steps include:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring the dataset is clean, well-structured, and free of inaccuracies to allow for accurate analysis.

Data Analysis: Analyzing the data to identify sales trends, performance across product categories, and the impact of promotions. This analysis will also cover customer purchasing behaviors and any other factors that may influence Zara's sales performance.

Visualization in Power BI: Using Power BI to create visual representations of the data, which will help communicate key findings effectively.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes attributes such as product ID, product name, category, price, sales volume, sales date, and store location. Through analysis, we aim to provide Zaraâ€™s management with insights that can guide strategic decisions in marketing, inventory management, and other areas to optimize revenue and profitability.
